# Terraform: Multi-Compartment AWS Architecture

This directory contains Terraform code to build the **multi-compartment AWS architecture** from the design diagram: Internet compartment, GEN compartment, Workload compartments (X, Y, Z), Transit Gateway, and PrivateLink for system-to-system API consumption and exposure.

Any developer can run this in **any AWS account and region** by changing only configuration (Option A: Terraform variables + `.tfvars`).

## 1. Architecture overview

The design includes:

| Component | Terraform mapping |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Internet Compartment** | VPC with subnets: `public`, `firewall`, `interfacing`. IGW, optional NAT, TGW attachment. |
| **GEN Compartment** | VPC with `public`, `interfacing` subnets. IGW, optional NAT, TGW attachment. |
| **Workload X / Y / Z** | VPCs with `web` (X only), `compute`, `data` (X only), `interfacing`. TGW attachment. |
| **Transit Gateway (TGW)** | Central hub; all compartments attach via `interfacing` subnets. |
| **TGW routing** | Routes from each compartment’s private route tables to other VPC CIDRs via TGW. |
| **PrivateLink producer** | NLB + VPC Endpoint Service (e.g. Workload Z exposes an API). |
| **PrivateLink consumer** | Interface VPC Endpoint in a compartment (e.g. Workload Y consumes Z’s API). |

Traffic flow:

- **Public / GEN** → Internet or GEN VPC → (optional firewall) → TGW → Workload VPCs.
- **Workload-to-workload** → TGW or PrivateLink (consumer → producer endpoint).

## 3. Prerequisites

- **Terraform** ≥ 1.5.
- **AWS CLI** configured (or env vars `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`) for the account/region.
- Sufficient **IAM permissions** in that account for: VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Transit Gateway, EC2 (route tables, security groups), Elastic Load Balancing (NLB), VPC Endpoints.

---

## 4. Configuration (run in any account)

All environment- and account-specific values are in **variables** and **`.tfvars`**. To run in another AWS account or region:

1. **Region / project / environment**  
   In the environment’s `.tfvars` (e.g. `environments/dev/dev.tfvars`), set:
    - `aws_region` (e.g. `us-east-1`, `ap-south-1`)
    - `project`
    - `environment`

2. **CIDRs**  
   Ensure VPC CIDRs in `compartments` don’t overlap with existing networks in that account (or on-prem).

3. **Availability zones**  
   Set `availability_zone` in each subnet to valid AZs for the chosen region (e.g. `ap-south-1a`, `ap-south-1b`).

4. **Backend (recommended)**  
   Copy `backend.tf.example` to `backend.tf` and set S3 bucket, key, and optional DynamoDB table for the target account.

No code changes are required; only configuration.

---

## 5. Step-by-step: first run

### 5.1 Use the dev environment

All commands are run from the **environment** directory (e.g. `dev`):

```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
```

### 5.2 Configure backend (optional but recommended)

```bash
cp backend.tf.example backend.tf
# Edit backend.tf: set bucket, key, region, and optionally dynamodb_table for locking
```

### 5.3 Set your config

- **Quick test in default region:**  
  Ensure `dev.tfvars` has the correct `aws_region` and AZs for your account.

- **Different account/region:**  
  Change in `dev.tfvars`:
    - `project`, `environment`, `aws_region`
    - Every subnet’s `availability_zone` to match that region (e.g. `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`).
    - VPC CIDRs in `compartments` if needed to avoid overlap.

### 5.4 Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 5.5 Plan

```bash
terraform plan -var-file=dev.tfvars -out=tfplan
```

Review the plan: new TGW, VPCs, subnets, route tables, NAT gateways (where enabled), TGW attachments, routes to TGW, and optionally PrivateLink producer/consumer.

### 5.6 Apply

```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

Or:

```bash
terraform apply -var-file=dev.tfvars
```

---

## 6. Step-by-step: apply and verify

### 6.1 After apply

- **Outputs** (e.g. `terraform output`):
    - `transit_gateway_id`, `vpc_compartment_ids`, `tgw_attachment_ids`
    - `privatelink_producer_service_names` (for consumers)
    - `subnet_ids_by_compartment`

### 6.2 Verify connectivity (conceptual)

- From a host in a workload VPC (e.g. Workload X), ensure to have a route to other compartment CIDRs (e.g. 10.0.0.0/16, 10.1.0.0/16) via the TGW (check route tables and security groups).
- For PrivateLink: from a host in the consumer compartment (e.g. Workload Y), resolve the endpoint’s DNS and connect to the producer (e.g. Workload Z) on the configured port (e.g. 443).

### 6.3 Cost notes

- NAT Gateways and Transit Gateway attachments incur cost. In dev, `single_nat_gateway = true` and fewer NATs are used.
- Destroy when not needed: `terraform destroy -var-file=dev.tfvars`.

---

## 7. Adding environments (e.g. staging, prod)

1. Copy the `dev` environment:

   ```bash
   cp -r terraform/environments/dev terraform/environments/staging
   ```

2. In the new folder:
    - Rename or add `staging.tfvars` with `environment = "staging"`, production-ready CIDRs, and AZs.
    - Optionally use a different backend key (e.g. `key = "msf-assignment/staging/terraform.tfstate"`).

3. Run from the new directory:

   ```bash
   cd terraform/environments/staging
   terraform init -reconfigure
   terraform plan -var-file=staging.tfvars
   terraform apply -var-file=staging.tfvars
   ```

---

## 8. Naming conventions

Resources follow a consistent pattern:

- **Prefix:** `{project}-{environment}` (e.g. `msf-dev`).
- **VPC:** `{prefix}-{compartment}-vpc` (e.g. `msf-dev-internet-vpc`).
- **Subnets:** `{prefix}-{compartment}-subnet-{type}` (e.g. `msf-dev-internet-subnet-firewall`).
- **TGW:** `{prefix}-tgw`.
- **TGW attachment:** `{prefix}-tgw-attach-{compartment}`.
- **Security groups:** `{prefix}-{compartment}-sg-{type}`.

All resources are tagged with `Project`, `Environment`, `Compartment` (where applicable), and `ManagedBy = "terraform"`.

---

## 9. Module reference

| Module | Purpose | Key inputs |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **transit-gateway** | Create one Transit Gateway | `name_prefix`, optional default route table behaviour |
| **vpc-compartment** | One VPC + subnets, IGW, NAT, route tables, SGs | `compartment_name`, `vpc_cidr`, `subnets`, `enable_internet_gateway`, `enable_nat_gateway`, `single_nat_gateway`, `enable_security_groups` |
| **tgw-attachment** | Attach one VPC to TGW | `transit_gateway_id`, `vpc_id`, `subnet_ids` (interfacing) |
| **private-link-producer** | NLB + VPC Endpoint Service | `vpc_id`, `subnet_ids`, `allowed_principals`, optional `existing_nlb_arn` |
| **private-link-consumer** | Interface VPC Endpoint | `vpc_id`, `subnet_ids`, `service_name`, optional `security_group_ids` |

Root `main.tf` in `environments/dev`:

- Creates one TGW.
- Creates one VPC per entry in `var.compartments`.
- Creates one TGW attachment per compartment that has `interfacing` subnets.
- Adds routes in each compartment’s private route tables to CIDRs in `var.tgw_routes` via the TGW.
- Creates PrivateLink producers and consumers from `var.privatelink_producers` and `var.privatelink_consumers`.

## 10. Security Flaws

- **The "Single Point of Inspection” Bottleneck**

      The firewall is the only thing standing between the "Members of the Public" and TGW.
      If an attacker bypasses that firewall, then using TGW one can potentially attach any of the connected Workload Modules (X, Y, or Z).

- **Asymmetric Routing Risk**

      If a request comes in from the Internet, goes through the Firewall, through the TGW, and into Module X, but Module X tries to send the response back via a different path , the firewall will see the returning traffic as "unrecognized" and drop the connection.

- **Both the Public Internet and a Government (GEN) network to the same Transit Gateway.**

      Public Internet and a Government (GEN) are sharing the same "underlying router" (the TGW). 
      If the TGW Route Tables are not strictly isolated , a breach in the Public Subnet could theoretically allow "lateral movement" into the GEN Compartment.

## 11. Design Trade off

- **No inspection of traffic moving between modules. Firewalls at edge only**

- **Routing complexity.Difficult to pivot from**

- **Difficult to trace internal routing so less visibility on components who are speak to one another**

## Summary

- **Config-only portability:** Change `project`, `environment`, `aws_region`, AZs, and CIDRs in `.tfvars` (and backend) to run in any account/region.
- **Diagram alignment:** Internet, GEN, Workload X/Y/Z, TGW, and PrivateLink consumer/producer are implemented as described above.
- **Optional pieces:** Security groups per subnet role, NAT gateway, and PrivateLink are enabled via variables; disable or adjust in your `.tfvars` as needed.
